### OVERVIEW
A 2022 10alytics hackathon:
The data consists of a variety of records from the World Bank. These data include: World population, Causes of Death, Death by age group, health expenditure reflected as a percentage of GDP, and Country codes. 

Different plots were generated after gathering and cleaning data sets. Merging of data sets was necessary to have a well-defined data table.

Recommendations were made at the end from insights obtained from the various charts that were generated.
